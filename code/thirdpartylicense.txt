CREDITS

MySQL++ was created by Kevin Atkinson during 1998. From version 1.0
(released in June 1999) through 1.7.9 (May 2001), the primary maintainer
was Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>. Neither Kevin nor Sinisa
are currently involved in MySQL++ development. The current maintainer
is Warren Young <mysqlpp@etr-usa.com>, starting with version 1.7.10 in
August of 2004.

For a fuller account of the library's history, see the first chapter
of the user manual.  For the nitty-gritty details, see the ChangeLog
in the root package directory.  ChangeLog items since 1.7.9 that
aren't attributed to anyone else were done by Warren Young.


Other contributors of note since 1.7.10:

	Chris Frey <cdfrey@netdirect.ca>: Lots of GCC warning fixes for
	the bleeding-edge compiler versions, and Gentoo ebuild support.
	Also, if there were a "steering committee" for MySQL++, he'd be
	on it.

	Mark Meredino <Mark_Merendino@cnt.com>: Several fixes and
	additions, including a lot of work on Microsoft Visual C++
	compatibility, and discoveries made while spelunking in the
	library.

	Evan Wies <evan@athenacr.com>: Contributed several C++ code
	style cleanups.

	Arnon Jalon <Arnon.Jalon@247RealMedia.com>: Added the multi-query
	result set handling features, and multiquery example to demonstrate
	it.

	Korolyov Ilya has submitted several patches in many different
	areas of the library.

	Remi Collet <Liste@FamilleCollet.com> is maintaining offical
	RPMs for Fedora, with other systems on the way.  His work has
	improved the RPM spec file we distribute greatly.

	Joel Fielder <joel.fielder@switchplane.com> came up with the
	original idea for Query::for_each() and Query::store_in(),
	provided the basis for examples/for_each.cpp, and provided
	a fix for exception flag propagation in Query.


Here are the personal credits from the old 1.7.9 documentation,
apparently written by Kevin Atkinson:

	Chris Halverson - For helping me get it to compile under Solaris.

	Fredric Fredricson - For a long talk about automatic conversions.

	Michael Widenius - MySQL developer who has been very supportive of
		my efforts.

	Paul J. Lucas - For the original idea of treating the query object
		like a stream.

	Scott Barron - For helping me with the shared libraries.

	Jools Enticknap - For giving me the Template Queries idea.

	M. S. Sriram - For a detailed dission of how the Template Queries
		should be implemented, the suggestion to throw exceptions on bad
		queries, and the idea of having a back-end independent query
		object (ie SQLQuery).

	Sinisa Milivojevic - For becoming the new offical maintainer.

	D. Hawkins and E. Loic for their autoconf + automake contribution.


See the ChangeLog for further credits, and details about the differences
between the many versions of this library.


Please do not email any of these people with general questions about
MySQL++. All of us who are still active in MySQL++ development read the
mailing list, so questions sent there do get to us:

	http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus

The mailing list is superior to private email because the answers are
archived for future questioners to find, and because you are likely to
get answers from more people.
